# A Green Azure Function

This function calls the [co2signal API](https://docs.co2signal.com/#introduction) by [tmrow](https://www.tmrow.com/) to get your region's carbon usage. Sign up for co2signal's API access here:

Create an [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=green-github-jelooper) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs?WT.mc_id=green-github-jelooper):

Once your function is deployed, you can use it for various purposes, for example in a [Logic app](/logic-app)

There's a LOT more you could do with API calls and Logic apps. What will you build? Let me know @jenlooper on Twitter!
