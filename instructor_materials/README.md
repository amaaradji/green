## Instructor materials

This content can be run as either a short [workshop](./workshop.md), where you will lead students in building a web app, or a [hackathon](./hackathon.md), where you can demo the way the web app and logic apps were built, and allow students to use green APIs to build a project of their choice.

Feel free to fork this repo and edit the instructions for your purpose.

## Leading a hackathon

On-the-spot short hackathons are more spontaneous, and don't require pre-work to build teams. If you want to run a micro-hack or spontaneous hackathon, use Teams Live to schedule and invite folks to your event. Consider partnering with other trainers to allow for breakout rooms on Teams if attendees need help or mentoring. At the time of the event, your schedule could be the following:

| Time       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 10 minutes | Introduction and welcome, explain the hack goals                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30 minutes | Play the video presentation by Asim Hussain, Cloud Developer Advocate, Green Team Lead who talks about Green Tech and how to be an environmentally responsible developer                                                         |
| 20 minutes | Code walk-through: use the included sample code to build a [Web App](../samples/web-app/README.md), or login to the portal to demo build a [Logic App](../samples/logic-app/README.md) to construct a Carbon Trigger application |
| 45 minutes | Live Hacking begins! Monitor the chat for opportunities to answer question and mentor                                                                                                                                            |
| 15 minutes | Encourage participants to share their work on Teams Live by posting the links of what they have shared.                                                                                                                          |

## Teaching a workshop

You can teach a code-along workshop using these materials. Student instructions are [here](./workshop.md). You could conduct this workshop via Teams or as a Teams Live event. It's a good idea to include mentors who can watch the chat and help attendees if they get stuck. 

Before the workshop, send out an email outlining your schedule and encouraging pre-installation of the following:

- the Vue CLI
- Visual Studio Code 
- the Azure Static Web Apps extension for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps)

Previewing the app: to simply try the app, pre-built, use the 'Deploy to Azure' button on the web app's [README](./../samples/web-app/README.md). The participant will fork this repo and all the code will be complete; the user can improve or change it. 

Getting started: to build the app from scratch, instruct users to use the VS Code Azure Static Web Apps extension. Point your users to the participant instructions and code alongside them.
   
You can follow this schedule during your event:

| Time       |                                                                                                                                                                          |
