# 🌱🌿Green Project Mini-Hackathon☘️🌳

Would you like to try to create a project that has a 'carbon trigger'? A carbon trigger can be created by calling an API that calculates when the electricity production in your local area is the most 'green' - a great moment to run a dishwasher or a gas dryer. 

## Suggested Projects

Create a web app that:

- changes color according to the carbon intensity of your region

- includes a running tally, updated hourly, with a chart of the carbon intensity of your region

- tells you which of your appliances would be good to run at which hour

Create a connection between an Azure Function using one of the APIs below to trigger a Logic App to do something like send a reminder to charge your EV

## Sample Code

TBD
